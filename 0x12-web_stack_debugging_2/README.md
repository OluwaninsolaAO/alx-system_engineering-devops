# 0x12. Web stack debugging #2

Debugging skills is an essential attribut of a good software engineer,
finding out what’s keeping your Ubuntu container’s Nginx installation
from listening on port 80.

> BTW: Feel free to install whatever tool you need, start and destroy
as many containers as you need to debug the issue. Then, write a Bash
script with the minimum number of commands to automate your fix.
