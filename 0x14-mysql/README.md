# 0x14. MySQL

Data replication in MySQL involves copying and synchronizing data from
one database server to another. This can help improve the availability,
reliability, and performance of a database system by providing multiple
copies of the same data. MySQL supports several types of replication,
including master-slave replication, multi-master replication, and group
replication.
