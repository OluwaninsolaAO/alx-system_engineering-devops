# 0x10. HTTPS SSL

SSL allows sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social
security numbers, and login credentials to be transmitted securely.
Normally, data sent between browsers and web servers is sent in plain
text â€” leaving you vulnerable to eavesdropping. If an attacker is able
to intercept all data being sent between a browser and a web server,
they can see and use that information.
