# 0x0D. Web stack debugging #0

The Webstack debugging series explores the art of debugging.
Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the
“fun” part of the job!).

Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack
Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given,
and the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once
executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before
writing this Bash script, a good developer will figure out what is
going on and fix it manually.
