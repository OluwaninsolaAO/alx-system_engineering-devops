# 0x11. What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

The web stack involves several components that work together to display
a website on your screen. First, the DNS translates the domain name into
an IP address. Then, TCP/IP establishes a connection between your browser
and the server, while the firewall ensures security. If HTTPS is used, SSL
certificates verify the website's identity and encrypt the data. The
request may go to a load-balancer, web server, and application server,
which handles business logic and data processing. Lastly, the database
stores and organizes all the website data. All of these components work
together to provide users with the information they need when they need it.
