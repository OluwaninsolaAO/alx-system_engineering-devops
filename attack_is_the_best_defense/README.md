# Attack is the best defense

Packet sniffing is the practice of intercepting and analyzing data
packets as they pass through a network. It is often used by network
administrators to troubleshoot network issues, but it can also be
used for malicious purposes such as stealing sensitive information.

To prevent packet sniffing, network encryption and other security
measures should be implemented.
